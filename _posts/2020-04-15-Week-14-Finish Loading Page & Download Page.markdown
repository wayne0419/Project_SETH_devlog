My research topic is to build a program that can automatically extract/locate timestamps of highlights from video game stream recording.
This project is going to help a lot for game streamers on platforms like Twitch, Facebook Live, YouTube Gaming Live and Chinese plafrom like Douyu, and game related video content creators on YouTube or Bilibili.
