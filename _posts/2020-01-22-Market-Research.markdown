# Relevant Products

**1. AthenaScope**
[https://athenascope.com](https://athenascope.com)<br><br>
This is a product that does really similar thing as what I want. However, according to this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/awba2d/athenascope_using_ai_to_make_highlights_from_your/),
I know that currently the product only captures highlight that are predefined game-specific events such as scoring or multi-kills. Highlights that are not in a specific predefined format such as hilarious failure or something with respect to playerâ€™s emotion will be neglected. This is where my project can help improve.<br><br>
