title:  "Week 11: Build Web Application FrontEnd Part 1"
author: CheWei

My research topic is to build a program that can automatically extract/locate timestamps of highlights from video game stream recording.
This project is going to help a lot for game streamers on platforms like Twitch, Facebook Live, YouTube Gaming Live and Chinese plafrom like Douyu, and game related video content creators on YouTube or Bilibili.

This week, my goal is to build up front end for the web application.

# 1. Learn Bootstrap

To saves time from diving into details of CSS, I decided to learn Bootstrap, an easy to use front end styling frame work.

Here are two main links where I learn Bootstrap from:

[https://websitesetup.org/bootstrap-tutorial-for-beginners/](https://websitesetup.org/bootstrap-tutorial-for-beginners/)

[https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/)

And I also reference  to the doc quite often:

[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/colors/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/colors/)

# 2. Start Building Frontend

I reference several existing websites to decide to layout of the web application and then start building.

Here is the result:

# 3. Next Step

Right now, I only finish the main page of the web application and it is not connected with backend yet.

Next week, I will keep learning more about bootstrap and finish the rest part of front-end work.
