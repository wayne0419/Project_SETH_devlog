Before the project "formally" started, the first thing I do is to set up this devlog.

Although I have quite some experience with web development like(html, css, React...), I dont really want to build a devlog website from scratch.

So I take Professor Austin Yarger's advice to try out the Jekyll static web generator, and it works well.
