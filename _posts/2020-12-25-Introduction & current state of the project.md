Thank you for your interest in Project SETH and reading this devlog.<br>
In this single post, I will give a brief introduction of what Project SETH is and also most importantly, 
the current state of Project SETH.



# What is Project SETH?

Project SETH is an independent research project started when I was a member of the undergraduate game related technology research
team at University of Michigan instructed by Professor Austin Yarger in early 2020.

The goal of Project SETH is to build a tool that can automatically extract/locate highlights from video game stream recording (actually not limited to video game stream, which I will explain later).
Project SETH is going to help streamers on platforms like Twitch, Facebook Live, YouTube Live, Douyu, and streaming related video content creators (e.g. derivative work or else) on YouTube or Bilibili.

The algorithm behind Project SETH is about "crowd-sourcing", which is very different from most video game stream highlight tools on the market (actually different from all of them as far as I know). Those video game stream highlight tools utilize computer vision and machine learning to extract and analyze the "content" of the video game stream and then decide when does a highlight occur. On the other hand, instead of analyzing the "content" of the video game stream, Project SETH analyzes the "reaction" of the crowd, and the crowd includes audience as well as the streamer. Since all the information needed for my algorithm are collected from the crowd, so it is called "crowd-sourcing".

One importrant benefit of Project SETH using my crowd-sourcing algorithm to detect stream highlights is that "audience reaction" is much more consistent with different genres of video game streams, even non-video-game streams(e.g. cooking stream), while the "stream content" varies a lot, and so Project SETH is a much more general and versatile solution to extracting highlights of all kinds of stream, on the other hand, for those highlight extraction tools that rely on analyzing the "stream content", for every new video game or new genre of streaming, they are likely to have to train a new model.
