My research topic is to build a program that can automatically extract/locate timestamps of highlights from video game stream recording.
This project is going to help a lot for game streamers on platforms like Twitch, Facebook Live, YouTube Gaming Live and Chinese plafrom like Douyu, and game related video content creators on YouTube or Bilibili.

# Who will benefit the most from this project?
The market sector of this project falls into the area where video game streaming is extremely popular, which are specifically:

**1. Game streamers and gameplay related video content creators**<br>
Game streamers and gameplay related video content creators will benefit the most from this project. To gain and maintain popularity to attract more audience to their watch stream, they often have to put lots of effort into creating highlight video of their stream, and this is a big chunk of work. One example I found is this highlight [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN99CJzuyes).
According to the description of this video, the author mentioned that he spent time reviewing a 14-hour-long stream recording to compress it into this 20-minute-long highlight video. The project will definitely save them a lot of time.

**2. Game company**<br>
Easy to get highlight help a game to grow its player base and this benefit game companies a lot. Remember when Overwatch just released. I often see people showing off their automatically generated “play of the game“ highlight with others, this really boost energy in the community of that game and can in turn prolong the lifespan of the game.
