My research topic is to build a program that can automatically extract/locate timestamps of highlights from video game stream recording.
This project is going to help a lot for game streamers on platforms like Twitch, Facebook Live, YouTube Gaming Live and Chinese plafrom like Douyu, and game related video content creators on YouTube or Bilibili.

This week, I and honored to interview with three talented gameplay highlight video Youtube creators. Idle名字可以隨時改, ICKID, LunMeow Com

Below is the compiled version of the result of the interview:


## What is the complete workflow of creating a gameplay highlight video(like: step1.. step2...) ?

**Idle名字可以隨時改**<br>
Download VOD -> extract highlight -> combine together, and add some visual effect -> check the fluency -> subtitle -> check subtitle correctness -> add VFX for subtitle -> upload to Youtube, make poster, Youtube advertisement setting -> sleep

**LunMeow & ICKID**<br>
Watch VOD in 2X speed to extract highlight -> combine hilight -> subtitle -> VFX -> checkout correctness and fluency -> upload.<br>
Also if keeping note about timestamps of highlight while watching live streaming, can save  lots of time.

## What is the most important part for a gameplay highlight video to be popular(ex: post-editing, visual effect, "highness" of highlight) ?

**Idle名字可以隨時改**<br>
If the content of the original streaming is interesting itself, there will be more audience to watch the highlight video of that recording.<br>
If the content of the original streaming is boring like grinding materials, weapons, less people will watch the highlight video of that recording.<br>
So, I would say it depends on the popularity of the original stream content.

**LunMeow & ICKID**<br>
It depends on the type of the content of the original streaming. If the streaming is about advertising a new game, then it will be needed to make the highlight video more interesting by post-editing and VFX.<br>
Generally, for a highlight to be popular, post-editing, VFX, and "highness" of the highlight itself are all important.

## How long does it roughly take to create a gameplay highlight video?

**Idle名字可以隨時改**<br>
&lt;6hrs recording  ->  15 mins of highlight video(without subtitle) takes aobut 4hrs. Subtitle generally takes 1 hour<br>
&gt;7hrs recording  ->  16-20 mins of highlight video(without subtitle) takes aobut 5hrs. Subtitle generally takes >2 hours

**LunMeow & ICKID**<br>
3hrs recording -> 15mins takes about 4-5 hours

## Among the workflow of creating a gameplay highlight video, how much time and percentage does manually detecting & extracting highlight from stream recording take?

**Idle名字可以隨時改**<br>
About 70%, sometimes if the highlight material is enought, I may skip the rest of the recording.

**LunMeow & ICKID**<br>
20% - 30%

## Is there any other part among the workflow that takes more time than manually detecting & extracting highlight from stream recording? How much time and percentage does it take?

**Idle名字可以隨時改**<br>
Some recording may involve highlight that is associated with something that happens in previous recording, finding them out takes lots of time<br>
Translation of recording of foreigh languages also take extra time.

**LunMeow & ICKID**<br>
1. Finding correct music, and adsut the sound track: for fast paced game like Apex legned, I often have to adjust sound track to match  the temple of player's action in the video.<br>
2. Subtile: this takes largest amount of time among the whole video editing workflow. Especially when the streamer plays with other streamers, then a 3hr recording which used to take 4-5 hrs to create highlight video will rise to 6-7hrs to create highlight video.

## Suppose there exist a tool that you input a stream recording and it will automatically produce multiple highlight clips as material for you to use, will this tool save your time? How much percentage?

**Idle名字可以隨時改**<br>
Maybe, but if it negelect  some highlights, that will be annoying<br>
But if it does well, it can definitely save at least 50% of time of the whole workflow.

**LunMeow & ICKID**<br>
Can definitely save lots of time, but even if i get an automatically generated highlight lists, I will still go back to check each of them on the original VOD to make sure.

## Suppose this tool has three following functions, which one will help you the most?
## 1. produce a list of timestamp showing when highlight happens
## 2. produce multiple highlight clips, one highlight per clip
## 3. stick all highlight clips from function 2 and combine them into a long video?

**Idle名字可以隨時改**<br>
Function 1 is super helpful

**LunMeow & ICKID**<br>
I like the function 1+3 combo, this allows me to fast check the "highness" using function 3 and then use function 1 to go back to the original VOD tomake sure

## Suppose this tool allows you to set up some parameters to affect the output(ex: the threshold of "highness" of highlight ). What possible parameters may be useful?

**Idle名字可以隨時改**<br>
Not think of any.

**LunMeow & ICKID**<br>
Text filter of chat.<br>
This allows creators to first use the tool and look at the no-filter generated highlight clips, remember those text in chat that cause outliers and then reuse the tool again with text-filter to filter out those outlier-causing chat text, and in turn generate better quality highlight clips material.

## Suppose this tool capture highlight by analyzing conditions of chat (ex: temporary burst increase in chat amount, text or emoji spam). Is three any kind of highlight that may be neglected? Or any kind of outliers?

**Idle名字可以隨時改 & LunMeow & ICKID**<br>
**Possible outliers:**<br>
1. Streamer and the audience greet each other in the front of the stream<br>
2. Streamer asks the audience a question, and then the audience answer<br>
3. Special streaming plugin for interatcion between streamer and the audience (ex: a streamer allows his audience to gamble with wheir loyalty point on some mini games, and how the audience place their bet is through typing in chat)
4. Audience interact with each other (ex: the chat room manager says will ban anyone spam "XXX", and then other audience make fun by spaming "XXX")
**Possible neglected highlights:**<br>
1. Some highlights consist of cause and result. The cause and result may cross a long time(ex: 15min). However, my current method to extract highlight can only capture the result and 30s around it.

## For streamers with much less audience in chat room, will it be difficult for this tool to detect highlight for their stream recording?

**Idle名字可以隨時改**<br>
Yes

**LunMeow & ICKID**<br>
Yes

## I heard that some streaming software support latency function(ex: 30s, 60s). Will this screw up the time line in chat log?

**Idle名字可以隨時改**<br>
Not a big deal, most streamers will try to minimize the latency.

**LunMeow & ICKID**<br>
That will not be an issue because the chat's timeline will still be based on the timeline of the stream video.<br>
It is like both chat and the video are lated together, then they compensate.
The only issue will be when streamers  talik in chat.
